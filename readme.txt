Turns WordPress into a publishing platform.
 
== Description ==
With Paperlit WordPress plugin, publishers can create their digital magazine without the hassle (and the cost) of platforms like Adobe DPS. Simply create the content for your issue, add it to your editorial project, export the issue and finally publish it using Paperlit.

The Paperlit WordPress Plugin extracts your collection of posts as a HPub file, which is compatible with the Paperlit platform. You can create an interactive digital magazine using Wordpress as your CMS!

With Paperlit, publishers can 
- Distribute their publication with a mobile app
- Categorise their content in single or multi-publication issues
- Connect live feeds to share exclusive content from their website or blog
- Publish their app on the App Store and Google Play
- Monetise their content with in-app purchase or advertising
- Distribute a digital version of their publication in a state-of-the art, mobile-friendly reader

Using Paperlit, you can preview your app on your mobile device before publishing with the Paperlit Previewer App.
